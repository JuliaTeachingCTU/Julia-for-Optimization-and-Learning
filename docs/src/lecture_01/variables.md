# Variables

In Julia (as in other languages), a variable is a name that refers to a value. Contrary to languages like C or C++, and similarly to Python or MATLAB, variables can be created without type specification, i.e., a variable can be declared simply by using the `=` sign

```jldoctest var_declaration
julia> x = 2
2
```

The type of the variable is inferred automatically and can be checked using the `typeof` function

```jldoctest var_declaration
julia> typeof(x)
Int64
```

In this case, the variable `x` is of type `Int64`, which is a type that represents signed integers. Since `x` is a number, we can apply basic mathematical operations to it

```jldoctest var_declaration
julia> y = x + 1
3

julia> typeof(y)
Int64
```

The type of the variable `x` is preserved because the sum of two integers is also an integer. We can also reuse the name of the variable and assign a new value to it

```jldoctest var_declaration
julia> x = 4
4
```

The type of the variable `x` is still `Int64`, but it is also possible to assign a value of a different type to `x`

```jldoctest var_declaration
julia> x = 3.1415
3.1415

julia> typeof(x)
Float64
```

In this case, the variable `x` is of type `Float64`, which is a type that represents floating-point numbers.

```@raw html
<div class = "exercise-body">
<header class = "exercise-header">Exercise:</header><p>
```

Create the following three variables:
1. Variable `x` with value `1.234`.
2. Variable `y` with value `1//2`.
3. Variable `z` with value `x + y*im`.
What are the types of these three variables?

```@raw html
</p></div>
<details class = "solution-body">
<summary class = "solution-header">Solution:</summary><p>
```

All three variables can be declared simply by assigning the value to the given variable name

```jldoctest var_types
julia> x = 1.234
1.234

julia> y = 1//2
1//2

julia> z = x + y*im
1.234 + 0.5im
```

and types can be checked using the `typeof` function

```jldoctest var_types
julia> typeof(x)
Float64

julia> typeof(y)
Rational{Int64}

julia> typeof(z)
Complex{Float64}
```

```@raw html
</p></details>
```

## Primitive numeric types

There are many types in Julia. In fact, every object in Julia has its type. As an example, we can mention the hierarchy of primitive numeric types

![](types.svg)

All types shown in blue are abstract types, i.e., it is impossible to create an instance of such a type. Abstract types are useful for creating logical type hierarchy. Types highlighted in green are concrete types. In many cases, it is useful to have the choice to choose which type to use. As an example, we can see floating-point numbers. There are four concrete types for floating-point numbers. If we want to maximize the precision of some calculations, we can use `BigFloat`. Using `BigFloat` increases precision but also increases computational time. On the other hand, if we want to speed up the code, we can use the type with lower precision, such as `Float32`. However, in most cases, the user does not have to take care of types and use the default type.

## Variable names

Julia provides an extremely flexible system for naming variables. Variable names are case-sensitive and have no semantic meaning, i.e., the language will not treat variables differently based on their names.

```jldoctest
julia> I_am_float = 3.1415
3.1415

julia> CALL_ME_RATIONAL = 1//3
1//3

julia> MyString = "MyVariable"
"MyVariable"
```

Here `I_am_float` contains a floating-point number, `CALL_ME_RATIONAL` is a rational number (can be used if the exact accuracy is needed) and `MyString` contains a string (a piece of text).

Moreover, in the Julia REPL and several other Julia editing environments, it is possible to use many Unicode (UTF-8 encoding) math symbols by typing the backslashed $\LaTeX$ symbol name followed by tab. It is also possible to use many other non-math symbols. For example, the variable name `Œ¥` can be entered by typing `\delta<tab>`

```jldoctest
julia> Œ¥ = 1
1
```

or pizza symbol `üçï` can be entered by typing `\:pizza:<tab>`

```jldoctest
julia> üçï = "It's time for pizza!!!"
"It's time for pizza!!!"
```

The list of all Unicode characters that can be entered via tab completion of $\LaTeX$-like abbreviations in the Julia REPL is provided in the official [manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/unicode-input/).

Julia will even let the user redefine built-in constants and functions if needed (although this is not recommended to avoid potential confusions)

```jldoctest
julia> œÄ = 2
2

julia> œÄ
2
```

However, if the user tries to use a variable name that corresponds to a built-in constant or function already in use, Julia will throw an error

```jldoctest
julia> ‚ÑØ
‚ÑØ = 2.7182818284590...

julia> ‚ÑØ = 2
ERROR: cannot assign a value to variable MathConstants.‚ÑØ from module Main
[...]
```

The only explicitly disallowed names for variables are the names of built-in reserved keywords listed in the following table

| Reserved words: |         |            |          |          |            |
| :---            | :---    | :---       | :---     | :---     | :---       |
| `baremodule`    | `begin` | `break`    | `catch`  | `const`  | `continue` |
| `do`            | `else`  | `elseif`   | `end`    | `export` | `false`    |
| `finally`       | `for`   | `function` | `global` | `if`     | `import`   |
| `let`           | `local` | `macro`    | `module` | `quote`  | `return`   |
| `struct`        | `true`  | `try`      | `using`  | `while`  |            |

```jldoctest
julia> struct = 3
ERROR: syntax: unexpected "="
[...]
```

In many cases, it is beneficial to have the choice to use special symbols as variable names. It may increase the code's readability, especially when the user needs to implement mathematical algorithms, where it is common to use the greek alphabet. However, excessive use of special symbols can be confusing.

```@raw html
<div class = "info-body">
<header class = "info-header">Stylistic Conventions:</header><p>
```

While there are almost no restrictions on valid names in Julia, it is useful to adopt the following conventions:
- Names of variables are in lower case.
- Word separation can be indicated by underscores (`_`), but the use of underscores is discouraged unless the name would be hard to read otherwise.
- Do not overuse special symbols, i.e., avoid using symbols like `üçï` as variable names.
For more information about stylistic conventions, see the official [style guide](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/#Style-Guide-1) or [Blue Style](https://github.com/invenia/BlueStyle).
