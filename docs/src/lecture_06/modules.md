# Files and modules

When writing a code, one may get in a situation, that the code is long and hard to understand. There are three main ways in Julia how to organize the code. The code can be split into

1. separate files,
2. modules, or
3. packages.

In this lecture, we will describe how to use these three approaches to split and organize code in a meaningful way.

## Files

The first and most basic approach is to split the code into multiple files. Such files have to be of the appropriate type, i.e. it has to be Julia files with `.jl` extension.

## Modules
