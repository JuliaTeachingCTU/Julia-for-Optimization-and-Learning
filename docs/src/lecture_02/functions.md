## Function basics

!!! info "Function declaration:"
    So far, we did not show how to define functions. However, the above example should show the basic syntax for defining functions. The `return` keyword specifies the function output. In this case, the function returns nothing since we only want to compare numbers. If we need to define a function that returns more than one variable, the following syntax is used.

    ```julia
    return x, y, z
    ```

    Here `x`, `y`, and `z` are some variables. We will discuss the function declaration in more detail in the [next lesson](@ref Functions).
