# Exercises

!!! tip "Example 1"
    Show that the primal formulation is equivalent to the min-max formulation.


!!! tip "Example 2"
    Derive the dual formulation for the linear programming.


!!! tip "SQP method"
    Derive the SQP method for optimization problem with only equality constraints. SQP writes the optimality (KKT) conditions and the applies the Newton's method to solve the system of equations.

    Implement the SQP method and use it to solve ???
