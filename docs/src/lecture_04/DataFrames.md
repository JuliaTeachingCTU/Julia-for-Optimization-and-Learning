# DataFrames.jl

[DataFrames](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/) is a package that provides a set of tools for working with tabular data in Julia. Its design and functionality are similar to those of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (in Python) and `data.frame`, `data.table` and dplyr (in R), making it a great general purpose data science tool, especially for those coming to Julia from R or Python.
